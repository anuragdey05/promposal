# Winter Ball Promposal Web App 

A playful, nerdy promposal website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Features  
- A fun promposal screen with a picture and two options: "Yes" and "No."  
- If "Yes" is clicked, success!  
- If "No" is clicked, the site keeps asking again and again.  
- Eventually, the "No" button starts randomly moving across the screen, making it impossible to select until "Yes" is clicked.   

## Purpose  
This website was designed as a creative and interactive way to ask my girlfriend to the Winter Ball. Itâ€™s a mix of humor, love, and a bit of coding fun!  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for the structure.  
- **CSS** for styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** for all the interactive and fun logic.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Enjoy the promposal magic!
